# Infra-Red-Remote-Control
I have a sound bar with an infra-red remote control. However the remote is very small and often gets lost or misplaced. I have set myself a project of building a remote to use as a back-up to the one supplied with the soundbar.
The initial requirement is to use as much as possible components I have at hand, and only purchase what is absolutely necessary. Also to use the minimum number of components.

I only intend to use the most commonly used commands and have a range of about 3 metres (10ft). The commands are:
    • ON/OFF
    • Mute
    • Volume Up
    • Volume Down
    • Sound Flat
    • Sound Movie
    • Sound Music

See IRDoc02c.pdf document in the doc folder for further information.
